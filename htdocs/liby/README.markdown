Welcome!
=======

liby.js is a small JavaScript library with a focus on lightness and performance. Also, it is fair modular.

Please, take a look at [some demos](http://kung-fu-tzu.ru/liby/tests/demo/demos-list.html).

Liby.js is by no means a framework, it only provides a minimum set of abstraction layers while allows you to use the native JavaScript and DOM as much as you love. The only exception is a compatibility layer for MSIE 6-8. This layer implements DOM Level 2 Events, Element interface (Element.prototype), XMLHTTPRequest and some other modern web standards, like a general purpose framework.

Most parts of the library is [paranoidly tested](http://kung-fu-tzu.ru/liby/tests/tests-list.html) with liby.js own async test framework. This framework has no dependencies on liby.js and are able to power a server-side project (for ex. [ngx_http_js_module](http://github.com/kung-fu-tzu/ngx_http_js_module/tree/master/js/tests/)).

Liby.js powers such sites as [Inshaker.ru](http://www.inshaker.ru/) (since 2007, uses 0.3 branch), [RetailStars.ru](http://www.retailstars.ru/moscow/) (since 2008, uses 0.2 branch) and [Programica.ru](http://www.programica.ru/baloons) (since late 2006, uses 0.1 branch). Yeap, all sites are in Russian. Please use Google Chrome translate functionality ;)
